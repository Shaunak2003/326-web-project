            <h2>Connection to the Real World</h2>
            <p>
                In this ever changing fast-paced world, college students face numerous challenges and the major one being the financial burden of getting an education. Student debt has 
                become a rising concern. Let's consider John, a student pursuing a CS degree at a reputed university here in the US is having a hard time making the ends meet. His textbooks 
                alone sets him down around $100-200 each semester, adding to the already high tuition, living expense and food. Because of this John like many of his friends has to take up additional 
                part time jobs or just relying on the student loan and getting a high-paying job as soon as he graduates. However, John's situation is not unique but according to BestCollege.com there 
                are around 43.4 million Americans alone who have student debt as of 2023 which hinders their ability to fully pursue their academic journey without feeling any sort of monetary pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is exactly where UMarket steps in, offering a solution to this rapidly rising problem. By providing a dedicated space for students to buy and sell good condition second hand items ranging 
                from textbooks and electronic to furniture and clothing, UMarket evolves as a lifeline for students like John and many others who are seeking affordable alternatives to these traditional retail purchases.
                Through the platform, anyone can browse slightly used books, good condition electronics like laptops and ipads, furniture of people graduating or mint condition clothes for those looking to stay with the 
                trends all at a fraction of the cost. The advanced search offers user to get instant results through filters like condition, price-range, open-to-negotiation, ratings and many more. Another key feature of the platform 
                is it allows for buyer-seller communication which allows both parties to answer questions and be satisfied before making a sale or a purchase. UMarket also aims at promoting sustainability by encouraging reuse 
                of products and reducing waste and environmental impact to a great extent. It also provides a space for users to share photos of using the purchased products which creates a sense of bonding and developing a closely 
                knit community that promotes and encourages sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                To conclude, UMarket offers a tangible solution to the real-life problem of financial debt among college students. By providing a website to buy and sell second hand items, UMarket alleviates the burden of high costs 
                associated with acquiring essential goods for the academic journey. Through the emphasis on affordability and sustainability, UMarket not only helps students save money but also fosters a sense of environmental sustainability

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>
                UMarket serves as a culmination of the university education and personal growth, reflecting the integrative experience requirements of our coursework and individual journey. As students majoring in CS, Math, Business and Economics, 
                our diverse academics backgrounds converge to inform and shape the development of this project. Throughout the project, students have gained valuable skills related to web development like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL etc while at 
                the same time also learning about soft skills like collaboration, communication and team work to say the least. For instance, the coursework in CS has equipped us with the technical skills to build and maintain the platform 
                while business administration has provided us with market strategy and analysis, Economics has helped with finding the TAM of this product and its industry and at the same time develop strategies for the project.
                
                Furthermore, UMarket provides a platform for practicing critical thinking and problem solving within an interdisciplinary framework. Students are challenged to consider the difficulties faced by students with financial debts which 
                necessitates a deep dive into each discipline's methodologies and theoretical foundations, encouraging everyone to think critically about how diverse areas of knowledge intersect. UMarket also centralizes collaboration and advanced 
                communication. The project requires students to work in teams and combine their diverse preferences and skills sets to create a functional and cohesive platform. Working towards this projects also embodies working in real-world scenarios 
                where cross-functional teams work together to tackle pressing issues, negotiate different ideas and viewpoints and combine to create a accessible for the audience.

                Lastly, UMarket acts an experience fit to be called as the IE, offering students a project through which they can apply not only their technical skills but their soft skills and cumulative learning to address a significant real-life issue.
                The project's real-life relevance not only motivates everyone but also acts a forum to reflect on their educational journey and understanding the value of different diverse courses they have taken and seeing the first hand impact of applying 
                those together outside of a classroom.
